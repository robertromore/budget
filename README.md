### ðŸš¨ Critical: Always Use Feature Branches

**Before making any changes:**

1. **Check you're on `main`**: `git branch --show-current`
2. **Create feature branch**: `git checkout -b feature/descriptive-name`
3. **Never work directly on `main`** - every change needs its own branch

### Development Workflow

1. **Branch Creation**: Use descriptive names (`feature/add-auth`, `fix/table-bug`)
2. **Focused Changes**: Keep commits small and atomic
3. **Testing**: Run `bun run build` and test functionality
4. **Clear Messages**: Write descriptive commit messages with context
5. **Documentation**: Update relevant docs when adding features

### Branch Naming Convention

- `feature/` - New functionality
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `perf/` - Performance improvements

**For complete guidelines, see [Development Guide](docs/development-guide.md).**
