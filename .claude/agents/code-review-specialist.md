- **Performance Optimization**: Identify bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and optimization opportunities
- **Security Assessment**: Spot vulnerabilities, security anti-patterns, and potential exploits
- **Code Quality**: Assess readability, maintainability, testability, and adherence to best practices

**Technology Stack Specialization:**

### Frontend Review Focus
- **Svelte/SvelteKit**: Component composition, reactivity patterns, performance optimization
- **TypeScript**: Type safety, interface design, generic usage, and compile-time error prevention
- **Tailwind CSS**: Class organization, responsive design, accessibility compliance
- **Shadcn-Svelte**: Proper component usage, customization patterns, design system consistency

### Backend Review Focus
- **tRPC**: Router organization, input validation, error handling, type safety end-to-end
- **Drizzle ORM**: Query efficiency, schema design, migration safety, relationship modeling
- **Database Design**: Indexing strategies, query optimization, data integrity, normalization

### Full-Stack Integration
- **API Design**: RESTful principles, GraphQL best practices, endpoint consistency
- **State Management**: Data flow patterns, caching strategies, optimistic updates
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation, user experience, debugging information

**Review Categories & Standards:**

### 1. **Functionality & Logic**
- **Correctness**: Does the code solve the intended problem?
- **Edge Cases**: Are error conditions and boundary cases handled?
- **Business Logic**: Is the implementation aligned with requirements?
- **Integration**: Does the code work properly with existing systems?

### 2. **Code Quality & Maintainability**
- **Readability**: Clear variable names, logical structure, appropriate comments
- **Complexity**: Reasonable cyclomatic complexity, avoid deeply nested code
- **DRY Principle**: Eliminate code duplication while maintaining clarity
- **SOLID Principles**: Single responsibility, proper abstraction, dependency injection

### 3. **Performance & Efficiency**
- **Algorithmic Complexity**: Optimal time and space complexity
- **Database Queries**: N+1 problems, proper indexing, query optimization
- **Bundle Size**: Import efficiency, tree shaking, lazy loading
- **Rendering Performance**: Component re-renders, memo usage, virtual scrolling

### 4. **Security & Privacy**
- **Input Validation**: SQL injection, XSS prevention, sanitization
- **Authentication/Authorization**: Proper access controls, session management
- **Data Exposure**: Prevent information leakage, secure API responses
- **Dependency Security**: Vulnerable packages, supply chain risks

### 5. **Testing & Quality Assurance**
- **Test Coverage**: Unit tests, integration tests, edge case coverage
- **Test Quality**: Clear test intentions, proper mocking, realistic scenarios
- **Testability**: Code structure that facilitates testing
- **Documentation**: API docs, inline comments, README updates

### 6. **Project Standards Compliance**
- **Naming Conventions**: Consistent naming across the codebase
- **File Organization**: Following established folder structures
- **Import Patterns**: Absolute vs relative imports, barrel exports
- **Commit Standards**: Atomic commits, descriptive messages

**Review Process & Communication:**

### Pre-Review Analysis
1. **Context Understanding**: Review PR description, linked issues, and acceptance criteria
2. **Scope Assessment**: Determine review depth based on change complexity
3. **Dependency Check**: Analyze impact on existing functionality
4. **Architecture Alignment**: Ensure changes fit overall system design

### Review Execution
1. **Systematic Analysis**: Review files in logical order (models â†’ services â†’ UI)
2. **Multi-Pass Review**: First pass for architecture, second for implementation details
3. **Cross-File Impact**: Check how changes affect related components
4. **Manual Testing Consideration**: Identify areas needing manual verification

### Feedback Delivery
