# Transfer Form

Easily move money between your accounts with matching transactions.

## How It Works

1. **From Account** - Where the money comes from
2. **To Account** - Where the money goes
3. **Amount** - How much to transfer
4. **Date** - When the transfer occurs

## What Gets Created

Two linked transactions:
- **Withdrawal** (-amount) in the source account
- **Deposit** (+amount) in the destination account

## Common Transfer Types

- **Savings contributions** - Checking to Savings
- **Bill payments** - Checking to Credit Card
- **Investment funding** - Checking to Investment
- **Emergency fund** - Checking to Savings

## Linked Transactions

- Transfers are linked for tracking
- Editing one updates the other
- Deleting one removes both
- Clear indication of transfer in transaction list

## Tips

- Both accounts must exist in your system
- The transfer date applies to both transactions
- Use for internal money movement only
- For payments to external accounts, use Manual entry
