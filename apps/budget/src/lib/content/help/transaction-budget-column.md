# Budget Column

The budget column shows which budget a transaction is allocated to.

## Display

- Shows budget name if assigned
- Empty if no budget allocation
- May show partial allocation indicator

## How It Works

- Transactions can be linked to specific budgets
- Spending counts against budget limits
- Enables project-based or goal-based tracking

## Allocation Types

- **Full amount** - Entire transaction to one budget
- **Partial** - Split across budgets (if supported)
- **None** - No budget allocation

## When to Use

- Tracking project expenses
- Goal-based savings
- Event planning (weddings, vacations)
- Department budgets

## Sorting

- Budget column sorting is disabled
- Use filters to find budget-specific transactions

## Visibility

- Hidden by default if no budgets exist
- Shows when budgets are configured
- Can toggle via View Options

## Tips

- Category budgets often auto-track without explicit allocation
- Explicit allocation is for special purposes
- View budget progress on the Budgets tab
- Over-budget transactions may show warnings
