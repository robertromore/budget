# Budget Category

Select which transaction categories this budget tracks.

## When to Use Category Selection

### Required For
- **Category Monthly** budgets - must select at least one category
- Tracking specific expense types (groceries, entertainment)

### Optional For
- **Account Monthly** budgets - filter to specific categories within an account
- Combining account + category for precise tracking

## Single vs Multiple Categories

### Single Category
- Track one specific expense type
- Clearest reporting and alerts
- Example: "Groceries" budget for Food category

### Multiple Categories
- Group related spending
- Example: "Entertainment" budget for Movies + Music + Games
- Useful for broader lifestyle categories

## Category Hierarchy

When you select a parent category:
- All subcategories are included automatically
- Selecting "Food" includes "Groceries", "Restaurants", etc.
- You can also select specific subcategories only

## Tips

- Start with one category per budget for clarity
- Use parent categories to keep budget lists manageable
- Create new categories if needed before setting up budgets
- Uncategorized transactions won't count toward category budgets
