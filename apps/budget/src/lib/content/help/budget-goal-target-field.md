# Goal Target Amount

Set the total amount you want to save for this goal.

## Setting a Target

Consider these factors when setting your goal:

### Emergency Fund
- 3-6 months of essential expenses
- Start with $1,000, then build to full amount
- Calculate: Monthly expenses x desired months

### Large Purchases
- Total cost including taxes and fees
- Add 10-20% buffer for price increases
- Factor in any down payments already saved

### Debt Payoff
- Total remaining balance
- Include estimated interest if paying over time
- Consider targeting specific debts first

## Progress Tracking

Once set, you'll see:
- Current progress percentage
- Amount remaining
- Days until target date
- Required contribution rate

## Tips

- Be specific - "$10,000" not "some money"
- Break large goals into milestones
- You can adjust the target as circumstances change
- Link to a savings account for automatic progress tracking
