# Associated Account

Link this import profile to a specific account.

## Benefits

When an account is associated:
- Transactions import directly to that account
- No need to select destination each time
- Speeds up the import workflow

## How to Use

1. Select an account from the dropdown
2. Optionally mark as default for that account
3. Save the profile

## Default Profile

When marked as default:
- Auto-selected when importing to this account
- Only one profile per account can be default
- Useful for your most common import source

## Tips

- Leave unset if you use this profile for multiple accounts
- Set a default for accounts you import to frequently
- You can change the destination during import
