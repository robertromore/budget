# Header Actions Mode

Choose where page action buttons are displayed.

## Options

### Keep on page
Action buttons appear within the page content where they're contextually relevant.

### Secondary to header
Move utility buttons (Analytics, Management, etc.) to the header bar while keeping primary actions on the page.

### All to header
Move all action buttons including primary actions to the header bar for maximum page content space.

## Tips

- "Secondary to header" provides a good balance
- Moving actions to header saves vertical space
- Primary actions are always easy to find in the header
