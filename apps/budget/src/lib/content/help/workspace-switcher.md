# Workspace Switcher

The workspace switcher lets you change between different workspaces and manage your workspace settings.

## What are Workspaces?

Workspaces are separate environments for organizing your financial data:

- **Personal** - Your individual finances
- **Family** - Shared household budget
- **Business** - Company expenses
- **Side Project** - Freelance or hobby income

Each workspace has its own:

- Accounts
- Transactions
- Categories
- Budgets
- Payees
- Settings

## Switching Workspaces

1. Click the workspace name in the sidebar header
2. Select a workspace from the dropdown
3. The app reloads with the new workspace data

## Managing Workspaces

Click **Manage Workspaces** to:

- Create new workspaces
- Rename existing workspaces
- Delete workspaces
- Set a default workspace

## Current Workspace

The active workspace name appears in the sidebar header with a user icon.

## Tips

- Create separate workspaces for different financial contexts
- Data between workspaces is completely separate
- Switch workspaces to see different accounts and budgets
- The last used workspace is remembered on login
