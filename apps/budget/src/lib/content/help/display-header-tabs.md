# Header Tabs Mode

Choose where page navigation tabs are displayed.

## Options

### Keep on page
Tabs appear within the page content, below the page header.

### Move to header
Tabs appear in the app header bar, creating a cleaner page layout with more vertical space for content.

## Tips

- Moving tabs to header gives more room for page content
- Works well with header actions mode
- Tabs remain easily accessible in either location
