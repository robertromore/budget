# Decimal Places

Control whether cents (decimal places) are shown in currency amounts.

## Options

- **Show cents** - Display full precision (e.g., $1,234.56)
- **Hide cents** - Round to whole numbers (e.g., $1,235)

## When to Hide Cents

- When you prefer a cleaner, simpler view
- When dealing primarily with larger amounts
- When exact cents aren't important for your budgeting style

## Tips

- Amounts are still stored with full precision
- Rounding is for display only
- This affects all currency displays in the app
