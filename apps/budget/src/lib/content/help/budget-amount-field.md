# Budget Amount

Set the spending limit or savings target for this budget.

## What This Means by Type

| Budget Type | Amount Represents |
|------------|-------------------|
| Account/Category Monthly | Maximum spending allowed per period |
| Goal-Based | Total savings target to reach |
| Envelope | Total allocation (doesn't reset) |

## Setting the Right Amount

### For Spending Budgets
1. Review past spending in this category/account
2. Set a realistic but slightly challenging limit
3. Adjust after a few months of tracking

### For Savings Goals
1. Determine your target (e.g., $10,000 emergency fund)
2. Consider your timeline and income
3. The system will calculate required contributions

## Tips

- Start conservative - it's easier to increase than decrease
- Use round numbers for easier tracking
- Factor in seasonal variations (holidays, vacations)
- Leave buffer room for unexpected expenses
