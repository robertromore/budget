# Default Mode

Set the default AI mode for intelligence input fields.

## Options

### Auto (Recommended)
Uses your last-used mode for each field. New fields default to ML.
- Remembers your preferences
- Adapts to your workflow
- Best for most users

### ML Only
Always use local machine learning for suggestions.
- Fast, runs locally
- No external API calls
- Good for privacy

### LLM Only
Always use language models for suggestions.
- Richer, more contextual suggestions
- Requires LLM provider configured
- Uses API calls

## Changing Per-Field

You can always override the default:
- Press **M** to switch to ML mode
- Press **L** to switch to LLM mode

## Tips

- Auto mode learns your preferences over time
- ML is faster but less contextual
- LLM provides better suggestions but requires API setup
