# Header Actions Display

Control the visual style of header action buttons.

## Options

### Icon with text
Show both the icon and text label on header buttons. Best for clarity and discoverability.

### Icon only
Show only icons on header buttons. Hover to see the label. Best for a compact header.

## Tips

- Icon with text is recommended for new users
- Icon only works well once you're familiar with the buttons
- This setting only affects buttons that have been moved to the header
