# Date Column

The date column shows when each transaction occurred and allows inline editing.

## Display Format

- Format follows your settings (Settings > Display > Date Format)
- Common formats: MM/DD/YYYY, DD/MM/YYYY, YYYY-MM-DD
- Scheduled transactions show future dates with a calendar icon

## Inline Editing

Click any date cell to edit:
1. A date picker popup appears
2. Select a new date or type directly
3. Click outside or press [[Enter]] to save
4. Press [[Escape]] to cancel

## Keyboard Shortcuts (in cell)

- [[T]] - Set to today
- [[Y]] - Set to yesterday
- [[Left Arrow]] / [[Right Arrow]] - Previous/next day
- [[Up Arrow]] / [[Down Arrow]] - Previous/next week

## Sorting

- Click column header to sort chronologically
- Click again to reverse (newest first)
- Grouped transactions maintain internal date order

## Filtering

Filter transactions by date:
- **In** - Matches specific date or range
- **Before** - All transactions before a date
- **After** - All transactions after a date
- **Between** - Transactions within a date range

## Tips

- Changing a date affects which budget period the transaction counts toward
- Scheduled transactions cannot have their dates edited here (edit the schedule instead)
- Future dates are shown for upcoming scheduled transactions
