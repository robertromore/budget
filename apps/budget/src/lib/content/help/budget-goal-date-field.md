# Goal Target Date

Set when you want to reach your savings goal.

## Choosing a Target Date

### Realistic Timeline
The system calculates required contributions:
- **Daily** - Small but frequent saves
- **Weekly** - Aligned with paychecks
- **Monthly** - Budget-style contributions

### Considerations
- Your current income and expenses
- Other financial obligations
- Seasonal factors (holidays, vacations)
- Buffer time for unexpected setbacks

## Status Tracking

Based on your progress vs. timeline:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| On Track | Meeting expected contribution rate |
| Ahead | Saving faster than needed |
| Behind | Need to increase contributions |
| At Risk | Significantly behind schedule |

## Contribution Frequency

Choose how often you plan to contribute:
- **Monthly** - Most common, aligns with budgeting
- **Weekly** - Better for variable income
- **Bi-weekly** - Matches many pay schedules

## Auto-Contribute

Enable automatic contributions:
- Creates scheduled transactions
- Transfers from checking to savings
- Adjusts if you fall behind

## Tips

- Set dates slightly before actual deadlines
- Be realistic about what you can save
- Review and adjust quarterly
- Celebrate milestones along the way
