# Font Size Toggle

Adjust the text size throughout the application for better readability.

## Size Options

| Size | Label | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **Small** | S | Compact text, more content visible |
| **Normal** | M | Default balanced size |
| **Large** | L | Easier reading, larger text |

## How It Works

1. Click the **Aa** button in the header
2. Each click cycles through: Small → Normal → Large → Small
3. The current size shows as a badge (S, M, L)

## What Changes

Font size affects:

- Body text and paragraphs
- Table content
- Form labels and inputs
- Navigation items
- Card content

## What Doesn't Change

These remain constant:

- Headings (proportionally sized)
- Icons
- Buttons
- Fixed UI elements

## Tips

- Large size is great for presentations
- Small size shows more data in tables
- Setting persists across sessions
- Combine with browser zoom for more control
