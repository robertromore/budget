# Transfer Tab

Create transactions that move money between your accounts.

## What Is a Transfer?

A transfer creates two linked transactions:
- **Outflow** from the source account
- **Inflow** to the destination account

This keeps your total balance accurate across accounts.

## Transfer Form

### From Account
The account sending money (defaults to current account).

### To Account
Select the destination account from your list.

### Amount
How much to transfer. Always positive - the direction is determined by the accounts.

### Date
When the transfer occurs.

### Notes
Optional memo for the transfer.

## Use Cases

### Common Transfers
- Savings contributions
- Credit card payments
- Moving funds between checking accounts
- Investment account contributions

### Scheduled Transfers
Consider creating a schedule for:
- Regular savings transfers
- Recurring loan payments
- Monthly investment contributions

## How It Works

When you create a transfer:
1. A withdrawal appears in the source account
2. A deposit appears in the destination account
3. Both are linked as a transfer pair

## Tips

- Use for any money movement between your accounts
- Creates matching transactions automatically
- Keeps account balances synchronized
- Transfers don't affect overall net worth
