# Budget Period

Choose how often your budget resets to its full amount.

## Period Options

### Monthly (Most Common)

- Resets on the 1st of each month
- Best for regular monthly expenses
- Aligns with paychecks and bills

### Weekly

- Resets every week
- Good for discretionary spending control
- Helps with frequent spending categories

### Quarterly

- Resets every 3 months
- Ideal for quarterly bills (insurance, taxes)
- Good for seasonal expenses
- Useful for tracking quarterly bonuses or income

### Yearly

- Resets once per year
- Good for annual expenses (insurance, subscriptions)
- Large irregular purchases

### Custom

- Define your own period length in days
- Examples: 14 days (bi-weekly), 45 days, 90 days
- Great for projects, events, or non-standard schedules
- Perfect for pay periods that don't align with calendar months

## Period Configuration

### Start Day (for standard periods)

The start day determines when each budget period begins:

- **Monthly**: Day of the month (1-31)
- **Weekly**: Day of the week (1=Monday, 7=Sunday)
- **Quarterly**: Day within the quarter (1-92)
- **Yearly**: Day of the year (1-366)

### Custom Period Configuration

When using a custom period, you specify both:

1. **Start Day**: Which day of the year (1-366) your first period begins
   - The description shows the actual date (e.g., "January 15")

2. **Period Length**: How many days each period lasts
   - The description shows the full date range (e.g., "Jan 15 → Jan 28")

**Common configurations:**

- **14 days from Jan 1**: Bi-weekly periods aligned with calendar year
- **14 days from your pay date**: Bi-weekly aligned with pay periods
- **30 days**: Month-like periods starting from any date
- **60/90 days**: Longer project-based budgets

## Tips

- Match your period to your pay schedule
- Use monthly for most budgets
- Use weekly for categories you tend to overspend
