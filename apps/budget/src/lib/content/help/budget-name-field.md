# Budget Name

Give your budget a clear, descriptive name that helps you identify it at a glance.

## Naming Tips

- **Be specific** - "Groceries" is better than "Food"
- **Include timeframe** if relevant - "Summer Vacation 2024"
- **Use action words** for goals - "Save for New Car"

## Examples

| Budget Type | Good Names |
|------------|------------|
| Monthly expenses | "Groceries", "Utilities", "Entertainment" |
| Savings goals | "Emergency Fund", "House Down Payment" |
| Projects | "Kitchen Renovation", "Wedding" |

## Character Limit

Names can be up to 100 characters, but shorter names work better in lists and reports.
