# Budget Field

Optionally assign this transaction to a specific budget for detailed tracking.

## When to Use

- Tracking spending against a specific budget goal
- Allocating expenses across multiple budgets
- Managing project-based or event budgets

## How It Works

1. **Select a budget** from the dropdown
2. **Allocation amount** defaults to the full transaction amount
3. **Track progress** in the Budgets tab

## Budget Types

- **Category budgets** - Track all spending in a category
- **Custom budgets** - Track specific goals or projects
- **Time-based budgets** - Monthly, quarterly, or yearly limits

## Allocation Options

- **Full amount** - Allocate the entire transaction
- **Partial amount** - Split between budgets (coming soon)
- **None** - Skip budget allocation

## Tips

- This is optional - leave blank if not needed
- Category-based budgets often auto-track without explicit allocation
- Use for special projects or savings goals
- View budget progress on the Budgets tab

## Related Features

- Budget recommendations suggest optimal allocations
- Over-budget warnings appear in the Intelligence tab
