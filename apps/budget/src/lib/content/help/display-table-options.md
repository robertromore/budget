# Table Display Options

Control how table column and display settings are presented.

## Options

### Popup dropdown
A compact popover that appears near the settings button with collapsible sections.

### Responsive sheet
A slide-out panel that provides more space. Appears as a side panel on desktop and a drawer from the bottom on mobile.

## When to Use Each

- **Popup dropdown** - Quick access without leaving context
- **Responsive sheet** - Better for detailed configuration with many options

## Tips

- Both provide the same functionality
- Sheet mode is better on mobile devices
- Choose based on your preference for quick access vs. more space
