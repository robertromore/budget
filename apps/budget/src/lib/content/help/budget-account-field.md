# Budget Account

Select which accounts this budget tracks transactions from.

## When to Use Account Selection

### Required For
- **Account Monthly** budgets - must select exactly one account
- Tracking specific credit card spending
- Monitoring individual account activity

### Optional For
- **Category Monthly** budgets - leave blank to track all accounts
- **Goal-Based** budgets - link to savings account for progress tracking

## Multiple Accounts

Some budget types support multiple accounts:
- Aggregate spending across related accounts
- Track combined credit card usage
- Monitor household spending from joint accounts

## Account Types

Different account types work best for different budgets:

| Account Type | Best Budget Use |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Checking | Day-to-day expense budgets |
| Credit Card | Spending limit enforcement |
| Savings | Goal-based budgets |
| Investment | Long-term goals |

## Tips

- Credit cards work well for tracking category spending
- Savings accounts pair naturally with goal budgets
- Leave blank if you want to track a category regardless of which account pays
