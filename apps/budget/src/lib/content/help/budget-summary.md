# Budget Summary

The summary cards provide a quick snapshot of your overall budget health.

## Summary Cards

### Total Allocated
The combined amount you've budgeted across all active budgets. This represents your planned spending limits.

### Total Spent
How much you've actually spent against your budgets. The percentage shows usage relative to allocated amounts.

### Remaining
The difference between allocated and spent amounts. Negative values indicate overspending (shown in red).

### Alerts
Count of budgets that need attention:
- **Over** - Budgets that have exceeded their limit
- **Approaching** - Budgets at 80% or more of their limit

## Status Indicators

- **Green** - On track, plenty of budget remaining
- **Yellow/Orange** - Approaching limit (80%+)
- **Red** - Over budget or overspent

## Tips

- Check alerts regularly to avoid overspending
- Consider reallocating from under-utilized budgets
- Review spending patterns to improve future budgets
