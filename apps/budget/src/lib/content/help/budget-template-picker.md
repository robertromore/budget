# Budget Template Picker

This dialog helps you quickly create budgets from pre-built templates. Templates provide starting points with suggested amounts and settings for common budgeting scenarios.

## How to Use

1. **Search** - Type in the search box to filter templates by name or description
2. **Filter by category** - Use the tabs to view templates for specific areas (Bills, Savings, Lifestyle, etc.)
3. **Select a template** - Click on any template card to use it as a starting point for your new budget

## Template Information

Each template card shows:
- **Name and icon** - Identifies the budget type
- **Badge** - Shows the budget type (Account Monthly, Category Envelope, etc.)
- **Description** - Explains what the template is for
- **Suggested amount** - A recommended starting amount
- **Enforcement level** - How strictly the budget is enforced

## Tips

- Enable help mode (click the ? button) to learn about specific sections
- You can still customize any template after selecting it
- If no template fits your needs, click "Create Custom Budget" at the bottom
