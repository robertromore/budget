# Budget Enforcement

Choose how the app handles budget limits and overspending.

## Enforcement Levels

### Strict
- Shows warnings when approaching limit (80%, 90%)
- Blocks or warns for transactions exceeding budget
- Best for hard spending limits
- Recommended for: Credit cards, discretionary spending

### Flexible
- Shows progress and warnings
- Allows overspending with visual indicators
- Best for guidelines rather than hard limits
- Recommended for: Variable expenses, new budgets

### Tracking Only
- No warnings or limits
- Simply tracks spending for reporting
- Best for observation before setting limits
- Recommended for: New categories, analysis

## Warning Thresholds

For Strict and Flexible modes:
- **80%** - First warning (yellow)
- **90%** - Second warning (orange)
- **100%** - Limit reached (red)
- **100%+** - Overspent (highlighted)

## Notifications

Based on enforcement level, you may receive:
- In-app alerts when adding transactions
- Summary notifications at period end
- Weekly digest with budget status

## Tips

- Start with Tracking to understand spending patterns
- Move to Flexible once you have baseline data
- Use Strict only for categories you want to limit firmly
- Combine enforcement with automation rules for power users
