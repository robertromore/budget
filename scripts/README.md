# Development Scripts

This directory contains automation scripts to improve the developer experience and maintain code quality.

## Available Scripts

### 🔍 `dev-check.sh`

- ✅ Build verification
- ⚠️ Scans for console.log/debugger statements
- ⚠️ Identifies TODO/FIXME comments

**When to use:**
- Before creating commits
- Before pushing code
- After major changes
- As part of CI/CD pipeline

### 🚀 `setup-dev.sh`

**Purpose:** One-command development environment setup  
**Usage:** `./scripts/setup-dev.sh` or `bun run dev:setup`

**What it does:**
- ✅ Verifies Bun installation
- ✅ Installs project dependencies
- ✅ Sets up database (schema + migrations + seeding)
- ✅ Runs initial health checks
- ✅ Formats code if needed
- ✅ Creates .env.local template

**When to use:**
- First-time project setup

### ⚡ `component-generator.sh`

**Purpose:** Generate new components using standardized templates  
**Usage:** `./scripts/component-generator.sh [TYPE] [NAME] [PATH]`

**Component Types:**
- `component` - Basic reusable component
- `form` - Form component with validation
- `compound` - Complex compound component

**Examples:**
```bash
# Generate a basic button component
./scripts/component-generator.sh component Button src/lib/components/ui

# Generate a user form component
./scripts/component-generator.sh form UserForm src/routes/users/(forms)

# Generate a compound list component
./scripts/component-generator.sh compound EditableList src/lib/components/compound
```

**Features:**
- 📝 Uses project templates from `.templates/` directory
- 🔄 Automatic name case conversion (PascalCase, camelCase, kebab-case)
- 📁 Creates directory structure if needed
- 🔗 Updates `index.ts` barrel exports automatically
- ⚠️ Prevents accidental overwrites

## NPM Scripts Integration

These scripts are integrated into `package.json` for convenient access:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev:check": "./scripts/dev-check.sh",
    "dev:setup": "./scripts/setup-dev.sh", 
    "generate:component": "./scripts/component-generator.sh"
  }
}
```

## Usage Recommendations

### Before Every Commit
```bash
bun run dev:check
```

### New Developer Onboarding
```bash
git clone <repository>
cd <project>
bun run dev:setup
```

### Creating New Components
```bash
# Use the generator for consistency
bun run generate:component component MyButton src/lib/components/ui

# Edit the generated file to implement your logic
code src/lib/components/ui/my-button.svelte
```

### Daily Development Workflow
```bash
# Start development
bun run dev

# Before committing changes
bun run dev:check

# If checks pass, commit
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"
```

## Script Features

### Error Handling
- ✅ All scripts use `set -e` for fail-fast behavior
- ✅ Colored output for better readability
- ✅ Detailed error messages and suggestions

### Safety Measures
- ✅ Directory validation before execution
- ✅ Confirmation prompts for destructive actions
- ✅ Backup recommendations for important operations

### Output Quality
- 🎨 Color-coded success/warning/error messages
- 📊 Progress indicators for long-running operations
- 📋 Helpful next-steps suggestions

## Customization

### Adding New Scripts
1. Create the script in the `scripts/` directory
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x scripts/your-script.sh`
3. Add to `package.json` scripts section
4. Update this README

### Modifying Existing Scripts
- Follow the established patterns for error handling and output
- Test thoroughly before committing changes
- Update documentation as needed

### Environment-Specific Adjustments
Scripts automatically detect the environment and adjust behavior:
- Development vs. production builds
- Different database configurations  
- OS-specific commands when necessary

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Errors
```bash
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
```

### Path Issues
Scripts should be run from the project root directory.

### Bun Not Found
Install Bun: `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`

### Database Issues
Reset database: `bun run db:restart`
